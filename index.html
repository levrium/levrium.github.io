            <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</p>
            <p>William Shakespeare</p>
            <br />
            <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</p>
            <p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</p>
            <p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
            <p>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</p>
            <p>Sometimes too hot the eys of heaven shines,</p>
            <p>And often is his gold complexion dimmed;</p>
            <p>And every fair from fair somethme declines,</p>
            <p>By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed:</p>
            <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
            <p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;</p>
            <p>Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade</p>
            <p>When in eternal lines to time thou growest.</p>
            <p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
            <p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>

            <p>YOUTH</p>
            <p>Samuel Ullman</p>
            <br />
            <p>Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind;</p>
            <p>it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees;</p>
            <p>it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions;</p>
            <p>it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.</p>
            <p>Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity,</p>
            <p>of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.</p>
            <p>This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty.</p>
            <p>Nobody grows old merely by a number of years.</p>
            <p>We grow old by deserting our ideals.</p>
            <p>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.</p>
            <p>Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.</p>
            <p>Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonders,</p>
            <p>the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and the joy of the game of living.</p>
            <p>In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station;</p>
            <p>so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the infinite, so long are you young.</p>
            <p>When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism,</p>
            <p>then you've grown old, even at twenty, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of optimism,</p>
            <p>there is hope you may die young at eighty.</p>
